## How It Works
It takes your final grades in Grade 9 – Grade 11 and a mock score in a test that either you think you will get or a simulation exam that you did.
Press the ‘COMPUTE’ button to see your computed UPG and know which of the top universities you qualified for.

## Under The Hood

Pressing the ‘COMPUTE’ button executes a function that uses the “right minus wrong method” to your score and the “weighted averages method”, where 60% is taken from the test score and the remaining 40% from your high school grades, to best approximate your UPG.

## UPG

The University Predicted Grade (UPG) is what the University of the Philippines uses to rank its examinees. It is ultimately used to determine your admission to any of its campuses.
